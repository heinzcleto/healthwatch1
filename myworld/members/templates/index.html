  <h1>Health Watch</h1>
  <p><em>We are developing
a watch that monitors the vital signs of its clients in a home setting and generates alerts and
other data based on the monitored vital signs.</em>!</p>
  <h2>About Health Watch</h2>
  <p>Health Watch was founded in 2022 by Heinz Cl√©to and Amen Enihoro. </p>
  <h3>Our Goal</h3>  
  <p><em>The goal of
the company is to allow individuals with health concerns to live a more independent life through
non-intrusive technology methods.</em>!</p>
  <p> An application example would be to help monitor people with
early-stage dementia and to help carers, clinicians and families support people with dementia to
live independently for as long as possible, while also providing peace of mind.
  <p>The company
provides various monitoring services and alerts such as routine monitoring, with alerts to family
members when normal routines deviate significantly. </p>
